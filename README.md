## Overview

This unofficial integration allows Home Assistant to interact with Nissan Connect vehicles via the legacy Nissan Connect EV (Carwings) API. It serves as an alternative to the discontinued core [nissan_leaf](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/nissan_leaf/) integration and draws inspiration from both the core integration and the [NissanConnect](https://github.com/dan-r/HomeAssistant-NissanConnect) integration for newer Nissan models.

## Key Features

- **UI Setup & Configuration**: Easily configure and manage settings directly from the Home Assistant UI.
- **Asynchronous Networking**: Ensures non-blocking calls for a smoother experience.
- **Quick Home Assistant Restarts**: Designed for minimal impact on Home Assistant's restart times.

## Installation

### Using HACS (recommended)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.][hacs-repo-badge]][hacs-install]

Or:

1. Open the [HACS](https://hacs.xyz) panel in your Home Assistant frontend.
1. Navigate to the "Integrations" tab.
1. Click the three dots in the top-right corner and select "Custom Repositories."
1. Add a new custom repository:
   - **URL:** `https://github.com/remuslazar/homeassistant-carwings`
   - **Category:** Integration
1. Click "Save" and then click "Install" on the `Nissan Carwings` integration.
### Manually

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
1. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
1. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `nissan_carwings`.
1. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/nissan_carwings/` directory (folder) in this repository.
1. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
1. Restart Home Assistant
1. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Nissan Carwings"

## Configuration

Configuration is exclusively done through the Home Assistant UI using your NissanConnectEV credentials. The initial setup will verify your credentials and fetch current data, which may take a moment.

## Adjustable Settings

- **Update Interval**: Frequency of data updates from the API, designed to not wake the car and drain the 12V battery.
- **Polling Interval**: Frequency of status requests to the car, which uses cellular communication and consumes a small amount of battery power from the 12V battery. Recommended setting is every 1-2 hours.
- **Polling Interval While Charging**: Similar to the Polling Interval but for when the car is charging. The default 15-minute interval is generally suitable.

## Services

- **Update**: Request update from the car
- **Start Climate**: Starts the climate control
- **Stop Climate**: Stops the climate control
- **Start Charging**: Starts charging
